      <h1>Why will people come to your site?</h1>
      <p>
        Recently, there has been a serious lack in availability of rulesets or game information for Trading Card Games (TCG) and Board Games. This is the reason TCG Matrix came into existence in the first place; To spread information about Trading Card Games and Board Games to players worldwide, in an easy access, user-friendly manner, all at the tap of a button, and all completely free of charge. This makes it much more convenient for newer players to have quick and convenient access to information they may need if they forget a rule, and for older, more experienced players to teach new players the games they already love.

      <h3>FAQ</h3>
      <p>
        What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them?
          Simply put, the goal of TCG Matrix is to answer rulings questions that both new and experienced TCG players may have while playing and learning. A few examples would be as follows:
          
          Q: If I am playing the Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game and we are using the modern format rules, am I allowed to draw for turn on the first turn of the game?
          A: Unfortunately, you cannot draw on the first turn of the game in Yu-Gi-Oh. However, there are alternative formats such as Eddison or GOAT in which you CAN draw on the first turn of the game.
          
          Q: How many creatures can I summon per turn in Magic: The Gathering?
          A: As many as you have mana for! There is no limit to the amount of creatures you can summon per turn, but you must pay the mana cost for each, unless expressly stated otherwise by another card effect.
          
          Q: If I play The Doom Card or a similar card in Bakugan Legacy, do I get to keep my opponent`s Bakugan after the game?
          A: Certainly not! After the game is complete, all cards, Cores and Bakugan are returned to their rightful owners, even if control of these game pieces is switched during gameplay.

          Q: Where can I find Keyforge TCG Booster Packs to strengthen my deck?
          A: Keyforge does not have Booster Packs! After you purchase your cards, the deck you have is the deck you have.

      <h3>Why TCG Matrix?</h3>
      <p>
        What advice would you give to a beginner TCG player who just can`t seem to win?
        Well, that would mostly depend on the game you`re playing, but a small piece of advice that will always apply to every game you play is this: Understand your deck. If you’re new to deck building, try to imagine the specific way your deck is going to win, rather than just saying “Make my opponent’s Life Points hit 0.” Or if you have just purchased a brand new deck, look through you cards, and try to understand what it is trying to accomplish. Rather than “Reduce opponent’s life points to 0,” it will be something like “Summon Rainbow Dragon Overdrive to clear your opponent’s field and attack for game.” Every deck has a plan, a strategy; an endgame. The best way to improve at the game is to find that endgame and get there before your opponent can stop you!
