        <p>    
            Simply put, the goal of TCG Matrix is to answer rulings questions that both new and experienced TCG players may have while playing and learning. A few examples would be as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
            Q: If I am playing the Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game and we are using the modern format rules, am I allowed to draw for turn on the first turn of the game?
            A: Unfortunately, you cannot draw on the first turn of the game in Yu-Gi-Oh. However, there are alternative formats such as Eddison or GOAT in which you CAN draw on the first turn of the game.
        </p>
        <p>
            Q: How many creatures can I summon per turn in Magic: The Gathering?
            A: As many as you have mana for! There is no limit to the amount of creatures you can summon per turn, but you must pay the mana cost for each, unless expressly stated otherwise by another card effect.
        </p>
        <p>
            Q: If I play The Doom Card or a similar card in Bakugan Legacy, do I get to keep my opponent`s Bakugan after the game?
            A: Certainly not! After the game is complete, all cards, Cores and Bakugan are returned to their rightful owners, even if control of these game pieces is switched during gameplay.
        </p>
        <p>
            Q: Where can I find Keyforge TCG Booster Packs to strengthen my deck?
            A: Keyforge does not have Booster Packs! After you purchase your cards, the deck you have is the deck you have.
