        <p id="p2-paragraph">The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, White Water Rafting Company offers rafting on 
            the Colorado and Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood Springs. Since 1974, we have been family owned and 
            operated, rafting the Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond. We have recently been trying to 
            innovate on the sport of White Water Rafting, and so it has become a monthly tradition to hold contests for Stunt Rafters!
            At the end of each month, competitors have the opportunity to show off and project to everyone just how crazy you can get with a raft and an oar!
            The winner of each competition walks away with free admition to our rapids until the next competition, and the opportunity to due it out with our very top Stunt Rafters in a special invite-only tournament!
            </p>

            <p id="p2-paragraph">
                The competition will be judged under three categories: Creativity, Difficulty and Audience Reception. Creativity will score the highest, so if you can do something that nobody has seen before,
            or something that is very unique or makes you think about things in a different way, that will recieve a very high score in our judging panel. Difficulty is obvious, nobody wants to watch a dude spin in circles for two minutes. 
            As for Audience Reception, if you can get the crowd cheering, if you can get them so smile, then that is exactly the type of thing we want! so go out there, get ready, and lets get rafting!
